# Filter Design
> This is an filter design assignment. 
> We have designed filter with the specifications as per the filter number M = 46 assigned. 
> We are using matlab program for frequency response, kaiser window function generation, plots and so on. 

## The Filter Specifications:
We wish to build a series of discrete time filters to extract specific bands of an analog signal, or to suppress specific parts of the analog signal. 

(i)   Passband AND Stopband tolerances are 0.15 in magnitude.
      That is, the filter magnitude response (note: NOT magnitude squared) must lie between 1.15 and 0.85 in the passband; and between 0 and 0.15 in the stopband.                       For the IIR    Filter, the passband magnitude response must lie between 1 and 0.85. 
      
(ii)  For bandpass filters & bandstop filters the transition band is 2 kHz on either side of the passband.

(iii) An analog signal is bandlimited to 140 kHz. It is ideally sampled, with a sampling rate of 320 kHz. The first filter to be designed by each student is a bandpass filter.           Filter numbers 1 to 75 have a monotonic passband, whereas filter numbers 76 to 150 have an equiripple passband.                                                               
      For filter numbers m and 75+m; m going from 1 to 75; the passband is from BL(m) kHz to BH(m) kHz, where BL(m) and BH(m) are numbers determined from m as follows. Define:           q(m) = greatest integer strictly less than 0.1m. For example, q(5) = 0, q(30) = 2 r(m) = m â€“ 10q(m). For example, r(5) = 5, r(30) = 10 BL(m) = 5 + 1.4 q(m) + 4 r(m).
      For example, BL(30) = 5 + 1.4 (2) + 4 (10) = 47.8; BH(m) = BL(m) + 10.
